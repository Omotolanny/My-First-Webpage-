        <h3>HOW to Write Function in Math</h3>
        <h3>Updated April 25, 2017</h3>
        <h4>You can graph circles, ellipes, lines and parabolas
          and represnt all these by equations in math. However, not
          all these equations are functions. In the case of a circle,
          one input can give you two output - one on each side of the 
          circle. Thus, the equation for a circle is not a function
          form.

          <h4>
          Apply the vertical line test to determine if your equation
          is a function. If you can move a vertical line along the 
          x-axis and only intersect one y at a time, your equation
          is a function as it follows the only one output for each
          input rule.
          <p>
            Solve your equation for y. For instance, if your equation
            is y-6 = 2x, add 6 to both sides to get y= 2x + 6.
